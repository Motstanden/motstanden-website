# Folder Structure

## Migrations
 - Contains the entire schema history for motstanden.db.
 - The current schema is generated by running all sql files in order.
 - The current schema is autogenerated and dumped into './schemas.sql'

### Rules
 1. Every change in the database must be deployed through a migrations script.
 2. Once a migration script has been deployed, they should never change or be deleted.
 3. Always update the database version in new migrations scripts. Example for the file: 01_new_sheet_archive.sql:
      ```
      INSERT INTO version(migration) VALUES 
      ('01_new_sheet_archive.sql');
      ```
