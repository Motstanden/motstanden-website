# Global owners:
# These owners will be the default owners for everything in 
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence,
# These owners will be requested for review when someone opens a pull request.
*       @torsteinws

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies TS files, only @ts-owner and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.
# *.ts    @ts-owner

# In this example, @db-master owns any files in the database/migrations/
# directory at the root of the repository and any of its
# subdirectories.
# /database/migrations/ @db-master

# The `doc/*` pattern will match files like
# `doc/getting-started.md` but not further nested files like
# `doc/build-app/troubleshooting.md`.
# doc/*  @doc-master

# In this example, @util-master owns any file in an apps directory
# anywhere in your repository.
# utils/ @util-master

# In this example, any change inside the `/client` directory
# will require approval from @dev-1 or @dev-2.
# /client/ @dev-1 @dev-2

# In this example, @client-dev owns any file in the `/client`
# directory in the root of your repository except for the `/client/public`
# subdirectory, as its owners are left empty.
# /client/ @client-dev
# /client/public
