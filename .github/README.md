# Code of conduct
  - This project follows the guidelines of [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow). 
  - English should be used everywhere. Norwegian is not allowed.


# Requirements
  The following programs must be installed and added to PATH.
  - [node 18](https://nodejs.org/)
      ```bash
      # Check which version is installed
      node --version
      npm --version
      ```

  - [sqlite 3.38](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html) or later.
      ```bash
      # Check which version is installed
      sqlite3 --version 
      ```


# Create the environment
  ## Create a SQLite database for development

  1. Copy dummy files into the directory where the node server expects to find files.
      ```bash 
      cp --recursive database/data/files/* server/files/
      ```

  2. Install tool dependencies

      ```bash
      cd database/tools/js
      npm install
      cd ../../..
      ```

      - This step might cause trouble for some developers because some systems may have difficulties installing `better-sqlite3`. You can troubleshoot this step by reading the documentation for the package:
          - https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3
          - https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3/blob/master/docs/troubleshooting.md

  3. Create databases, and populate them with data.<br/>
  **Note**: You need a unix shell for this step. If you are using windows, I recommend using [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
      ```bash
      cd database
      sh ./create_all_dev_db.sh
      cd ..
      ```
      
  You should now see two new SQLite db files that are fully populated with data: `database/motstanden_dev.db` and `database/sheet_archive_dev.db`

  ## Create server environment
  1. Copy and then rename the sample environment files.
      ```bash
      cp server/.env.sample server/.env
      cp server/src/info-mail-key.json.sample server/src/info-mail-key.json
      ```
      **Note:** Mail functionality does not work with this sample file. If you want to use mail functionality, you must either request a secret OAuth2 from Motstanden, or generate a secret OAuth2 key for your own mail. 

  2. Install dependencies
      ```bash
      cd server
      npm install
      cd ..
      ```

# Start project
   You will have to dedicate two terminals to run this project:

  ### Terminal 1
  This terminal is dedicated to compile TypeScript to JavaScript. The following script will start a file watcher that automatically compiles TS to JS. It will also print out **very useful error message** if you write bad TS.
  ```bash
  cd server
  npm run tsc-watch 
  ```
  You will now see two new directories: `server/build` and `common/build`

  ### Terminal 2
  Run start-up script.
  ```bash
  cd server
  npm run dev
  ```
  **Note:** There is a bug somewhere (probably in npm or react) that sometimes causes the startup script to fail. This issue often solved by rerunning the start-up script a few times.   

  The terminal is now running two servers:
  1. http://localhost:3000/ â€“ A front end server, responsible for compiling react and provide front end dev tools. This server is only used in development.
  2. http://localhost:5000/ - A back end server, responsible for handling API calls and serving content. This server will be the actual server running in production.

You can now go to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) and start developing.<br/>
To log in, enter one of the following email addresses and click the `DEV LOGG INN`-button. 
- contributor@motstanden.no
- editor@motstanden.no
- admin@motstanden.no
- superadmin@motstanden.no

# Testing

Run the end-to-end tests by following these steps:
1. Ensure that the website is running on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
2. Install test dependencies
    ```bash
    cd tests
    npm install
    ```
3. Run tests
    ```bash
    # [Very slow] Run all tests in all browsers
    npx playwright test

    # [Moderate speed] Run all tests in firefox
    npx playwright test --project firefox

    # [Moderate speed] Run smoke tests in all browsers
    npx playwright test --grep "@smoke"   

    # [Very fast] Run smoke test only in firefox
    npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project firefox

    # [Pretty] Run and render smoke test in firefox
    npx playwright test --grep "@smoke" --project firefox --headed --workers 1
    ```
Read more about testing in our [test documentation](/doc/testing.md)

<br/>
Now you have all the tools you need to start developing<br/>
**Happy coding!**


# Project structure

  - Contains everything that is related to the database.
  - The database is build in sqlite 3.31

## [client](/client)
  - Contains the web page that is rendered on the users computer.
  - The web page is a single page react app.
  - The project is generated using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See [doc/create-react-app.md](/doc/create-react-app.md)

## [server](/server)
  - Contains all code that is running locally on the server.
  - The server is running in node version 18.
  - The framework [express](https://expressjs.com/) is extensively used.

## [common](/common)
  - Contains code that is shared between the [server](/server) and the [client](/client)
  - Used for sharing utility functions and TS structures such as Enum, Interface and Type
